          I first started my career off working as a personal trainer and also working in gym management! I have always loved the fitness industry but I knew it was time a change! The UNCC's bootcamp for web 
          develpoment has been absolutely phenomenal. I am very excited to get into a technical career field and use the knowledge I have gained from this class in my career. I have always had an interest in
          technology and have always been fascintaed with computers from a young age. I am super excited to see where this career field will take me and what I can accomplish.
